/*
Graphs
Graph = G = { E, V }

One of the problems is how we represent graphs
adjacency lists is a good way to represent them

adjacency lists
    array Adj of |v| - > linked lists

    for each vertex u belongs v
    adj[u] stores neighbors


Graph search applications:
    -web crawling
    -social networking (example friends of friends)
    -network broadcast
    -garbage collection


Breadth -first search
    -visit all the nodes reachable from given vertex
    -in O(V + E)
    -Careful to avoid duplicates
